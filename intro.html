      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This webpage demonstrates the core building blocks of the web. Every webpage on the internet uses these technologies at some level.

        <ul>
          <li>HTML for structure.</li>
        </ul>
        <dd>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, serves as the foundational structure of web content, utilizing tags like < p > for paragraphs, < h1 > for headings and < img > for images to define and organize elements on a webpage. We can also create tables, lists, images as a gallery and display multiple links. Its key features include defining content hierarchy, embedding multimedia and providing semantic meaning to different parts of a document.</dd>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS for styling.</li>
        </ul>
        <dd>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is responsible for the presentation and visual styling of HTML elements, allowing developers to control aspects such as colors, fonts, layout and responsiveness across various screen sizes. Its features include a powerful box model for element positioning, a cascading and inheritance mechanism for efficient style application and selectors for targeting specific HTML elements to apply styles dynamically.</dd>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript for interactivity.</li>
        </ul>
        <dd>JavaScript is a versatile scripting language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages enabling features like displaying alert messages, form validation, animations and real-time updates without requiring a page reload. Its key features include event handling for user interactions, manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically change content and style and asynchronous operations for fetching data from servers, creating rich and engaging user experiences.</dd>
